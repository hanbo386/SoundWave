SoundWave
=========
This is a brief demo of testing a tcp based NodeJS server using socket.io module.
The project file includes three independent files.
After you download the project file, you can switch to the nodeServer file and run command: $node app.js
The SoundPlayer file contains an ipad APP project that can automaticly connect to the node server and prepare a piece of music
to be played.
The WaveViewer file also contains an ipad APP project that can automaticly connect to the node server and prepare an oscillography
to be showed.
You should initate the node server first and then set up the other two apps.
Touch the soundPlayer demo on screen, the demo music will be played while on the other pad, the wave of the music will be 
showed synchronously.
